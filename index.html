    <h1>Bay Ridge Community and Local Advocacy Groups Support Undocumented Asian Family Who Faced Deportation</h1>
  <p> By Shari Straker</p>
    <div>
      <p> Residents in Bay Ridge rallied around an undocumented Asian family with three American born children who were facing deportation at their ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) check-in at Federal Plaza. </p>
      <p> Joe and Mei Chen have been living undocumented in the United States for the past twenty years. They are both originally from Fujian, China. The family are members of the Lutheran Church of the Good Shepherd in Bay Ridge where they have gained an immense amount of support.</p>
      <p>Every Thursday at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan New Sanctuary Coalition holds a silent march which is called a Jericho Walk, where they walk around the building seven times praying in solidarity, for anyone who they have accompanied to their ICE check-in.</p>
      <p> The Chen family’s check-in also happened to fall on a Thursday and it was no different as, Bay Ridge for Social Justice and members of Lutheran Church of the Good Shepherd faced the building holding their hands up in prayer and thought of the Chen family as they waited for a decision.</p>
      <p> The groups said that it was at some point during the third time they circled around 26 Federal Plaza in silence, that they learned that the Chen family, had been granted a one year reprieve. </p>
      <p> Laura Vidal Leib 34, has attended church with the Chen family for the past five years and has said that they are good people who are valued members of the community. </p>
      <p> Leib strongly believes in the importance of showing support to those who are in jeopardy of deportation. “These days if you care about people facing immigration difficulties, it is crucial to physically show up for them and bear witness,” she said. </p>
      <p> Joe Chen, 38 first immigrated to the United States in 1997 at the age of 17 and has been to over 40 ICE check-ins. </p>
      <p> During President Trump’s first week in office he called for an overhaul of the enforcement of immigration laws. As a result, immigration arrests were up 38 percent during the first three months of the new administration compared to the same time last year. </p>
      <p> Lenni Benson, a Professor of Law at New York Law School, said community support is important but it won’t guarantee that you’ll be granted a reprieve. Families have been deported who have had the same amount of support or more than the Chen’s. </p>
      <p> Benson said that it depends on the environment of the ICE office you’re checking into,“they all have different cultures so, here in New York in many ways its more generous. But in upstate New York they’re being harsher.” </p>
      <p> During President Obama’s first term from 2011 to 2012 there was a 12,943 increase in removals. From 2013 to 2016 during the president's second term, ICE removals declined. According to ICE data 240,255 undocumented immigrants were deported in 2016, a two percent increase from 2015 but a 24 percent decrease from 2014. </p>
      <p> The government's 2017 fiscal year ended in September and has recently been released. The data shows that 2017 had the highest administrative ICE arrests within the past three years. </p>
      <p> Benson said ICE removal data comes in a variety of forms and may not always be reflective of accurate removals throughout the country. Removals fall under a plethora of categories that range from immigration hearings, aggravated removals without a hearing and removals at the border. </p>
      <p> Benson said that ICE data is only partial data since some of the removals throughout the year are also conducted by CBP (U.S. Customs and Border Protections). “88 percent of all removals are done through expedited removal at airports, at the borders and administrative removal,” she said. </p>
      <p> Rita Pihra-Majuriner a music director at the church, has been friends with the Chen family for over nine years, is horrified that the government would want to tear families apart. “All three children were born here, they’re citizens here.” She added. “So, if the parents are detained and ultimately sent back do they take the children? Do they leave them here?” </p>
      <p> Marjuriner described the ICE check-ins as dehumanizing and that the system has made her question her faith. “It’s very hard for me to understand and reconcile with my faith that this is how we treat people who we call children of God.” </p>
